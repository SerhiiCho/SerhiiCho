### Hi coders ðŸ‘‹

I'm mostly focusing on the server side. Working with PHP and GO. I was fortunate to have some challenging projects on freelance that helped me to try lots of different technologies. You can find them in my portfolio. There you can also check my open source packages and all information that you would need with links to projects, screenshots and small descriptions.
